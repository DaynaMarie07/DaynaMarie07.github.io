            <p>Hello! My name is Dayna Payne, a recent graduate of F.I.R.S.T. institute, in Orlando, Fl. 
            I received  a certificate in Graphic Design and Web Development! I continued to crave more knowledge 
            about web development and decided to enroll in UCFs coding bootcamp. By the end of the program I will 
            be a Full Stack Developer.  I also, have experience with Adobe products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator,
            InDesign, Bridge, etc.  I am also a passionate Photographer,  I have done weddings, portraits, children, families,
            events and many more. I have even worked with the talented Dean Cundy, cinematographer, for films such as: 
            'Jurassic Park', 'Back to the Future'  and many more. I incorporate my photography by offering photo content 
            on my clients web sites. </p>
